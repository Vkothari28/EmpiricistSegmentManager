Quesitons for Professor Heineman:

- What is LambdaLogger, and where do we get it? (ListAllConstantsHandler)
- What code goes into a Lambda Function
	- How does that code maintain dependencies? How does it have access to eclipse?
- How does the lambda function connect to the HTML?
- How do you connect the HTML to the API?
- How do you do the DatabaseUtil properly? I'm not sure where to find a place to create an environment variable
